    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Soon after finishing my mechanics diploma I began working for the chemical factory "BASF" as a process operator.
        In the 13 years I've worked there I've grown from junior process opeator to senior with multiple side projects. 
        Due to my personal interest for computer technology I've had the opportunity to automate some processes within BASF. But my passion was bigger than what I could do as a process operator. That is why I decided to follow my dream and chase a career in the IT. That dream looked like an unreachable goal at first, combining education with a family and a full time job, but after months of determination and training I manage to achieve my first certification (RHCSA) with a score of 283/300.
